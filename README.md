This game will focus on the motion of running. To achieve good health individuals, go on running trips that helps with many aspects of said health. Running, however, can be very tedious and the reward for running is often sore legs and being winded. While pain is hard to remove with an app the reward system is a possible solution, which is what we will focus on.  

With the sensors we will focus on (GPS) to show how far the user has been running to give a sense of gratification. An (accelerometer) will be used to determine if the user is standing still or running. This will be used to determine if the user “dies” since the monsters has caught up to the user. This will also give a sense of satisfaction when outrunning the monsters. 

Some adjustments were made to increase the flow of the app.  

The GPS will still be used to determine the length of the concurrent run. The accelerometer is used to determine the user’s speed, if the user is running below 50% of their average speed, the display will show that the zombies are catching up, followed by a vibration from the phone. The user will not die if the zombies catch up to the user since restarting the app while on the run was detrimental to the experience.  

In the report a UML-diagram showing the content of our two activities, and the code for these activities will be explained.
